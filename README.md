# PrinterView
A simple web app for viewing the status of multiple printers in a single page.

Added from original repo:
- Editing printers
- Hopefully better flow
- OctoPrint Javascript Client Library
- Refresh isn't crazy anymore. Certainly no infinite loops.
- Miscellaneous improvements...

# Installation

Go to [bachone.github.io/PrinterView](http://bachone.github.io/PrinterView/)

Should work on mobile as well. Not much from the original design had changed, so [this](https://github.com/quillford/PrinterView/wiki) will still work for now.
